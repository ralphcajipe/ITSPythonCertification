# ITS Python Certification Study Guide

This repo is in development. It is used to keep resources, course references, and code examples while preparing for the ITS Python Certification exam

Trainees preparing for the ITS Python exam should be able to recognize and write syntactically correct Python code, recognize data types supported by Python, and recognize and write Python code that will logically solve a given problem.

GMetrix practice exams are designed to expose trainees to hands-on experience with the Python programming language, features, capabilities, writing, debugging, and maintaining well-formed, well documented Python code.
